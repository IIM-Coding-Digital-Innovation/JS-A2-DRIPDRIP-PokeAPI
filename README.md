## Introduction
Our project uses the PokeAPI API to create an interactive experience for Pokemon fans. With our tool, users can sort Pokemons by type and generation, search for a particular Pokemon using its name or ID, and even access fun mini-games such as "Pokefight" and "Guess The Pokemon". Besides, users can also create their own battle team and explore the abilities of each Pokemon in their team. We hope you enjoy our use of the PokeAPI to make these features available to Pokemon fans.
